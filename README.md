Testing Tools For The 42 Vienna Piscine

# What it does:
1. Call the functions with some test data
2. Execute norminette
3. List all the Files that git will push to your repo (so you can make sure that the test files will not be in your final repo)

Feel free to use it, feedback and modify it. If you have any questions, let me know

# Usage:
1. Make sure that you have already created all the exercise directories and required files for the project
2. Move main.c and test.sh to the root of your project repo
3. Execute test.sh with `bash test.sh` (or `chmod 755 test.sh` first to execute with `./test.sh`)
4. Add main.c and test.sh to .gitignore

# Known Bugs:
Right now it only checks for c01/ex00-ex07 (didn't do ex08)
